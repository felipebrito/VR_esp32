# ESP32 VR LED Controller

A PlatformIO-based ESP32 project that controls 16 WS2812B LEDs and acts as a WebSocket server for VR headset communication, with two buttons for playback control.

## ✨ Features

- **16 WS2812B LED Control**: Player 1 (LEDs 1-8) and Player 2 (LEDs 9-16)
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication with VR headsets/APARATO
- **Button Controls**: Play/Pause/Stop/Reset for each player independently
- **Progress Visualization**: Bidirectional LED progress bars (0-100%)
- **Direct LED Control**: Commands `led1:X` and `led2:X` for precise control
- **Multiple LED Effects**: Rainbow, pulse, chase, and more
- **Python Simulators**: Multiple test clients for development
- **Fluid Animations**: Smooth LED transitions without flickering

## Software Setup

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed
- Python 3.x (for simulator)
- ESP32 development board
- WS2812B LED strip (16 LEDs)

### ESP32 Firmware Installation

1. **Clone/Download this project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd BIJARI_VR
   ```

2. **Open in PlatformIO**
   ```bash
   pio project init --board esp32dev
   ```

3. **Compile and Upload**
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

4. **Monitor Serial Output**
   ```bash
   pio device monitor
   ```

### Python Simulator Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd python_client
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Simulator**
   ```bash
   python simulator.py
   ```

## Usage

### ESP32 Operation

1. **Power On**: ESP32 connects to WiFi and starts WebSocket server
2. **LED Status**: 
   - **Off**: No players connected
   - **Green Blinking**: Player ready and waiting
   - **Blue Progress**: Player 1 playing (LEDs 1→8)
   - **Red Progress**: Player 2 playing (LEDs 16→9)

### Button Controls

- **Button 1 (D4) - Player 1 Control**: 
  - Short press: Play/Pause/Resume Player 1
  - Long press (>1s): Stop all players and turn off LEDs

- **Button 2 (D5) - Player 2 Control**:
  - Short press: Play/Pause/Resume Player 2
  - Long press (>1s): Reset all players and turn off LEDs

### WebSocket Protocol

#### Commands from VR Headset/APARATO to ESP32:

**Simple String Commands:**
- `on1` - Player 1 ready (green blinking)
- `play1` - Player 1 starts 5-second animation
- `on2` - Player 2 ready (green blinking)  
- `play2` - Player 2 starts 5-second animation
- `led1:X` - Set Player 1 progress to X% (0-100)
- `led2:X` - Set Player 2 progress to X% (0-100)

**JSON Commands (Legacy Support):**
```json
// Player ready
{"player": 1, "status": "ready"}

// Player playing with progress
{"player": 1, "status": "playing", "progress": 0.45}

// Player paused
{"player": 1, "status": "paused"}

// Player stopped
{"player": 1, "status": "stopped"}
```

#### Player States:
- **DISCONNECTED**: Player not connected
- **CONNECTED**: Player connected but not ready
- **READY**: Player ready (green blinking LEDs)
- **PLAYING**: Player actively playing (progress LEDs)
- **PAUSED**: Player paused (dimmed progress LEDs)

### Python Simulators

**Available Test Scripts:**

1. **`simulator.py`** - Interactive manual testing
   ```bash
   python simulator.py <ESP32_IP> <PLAYER_ID>
   ```

2. **`aparato_test.py`** - APARATO-specific commands
   ```bash
   python aparato_test.py <ESP32_IP>
   ```

3. **`led_control_test.py`** - Direct LED control testing
   ```bash
   python led_control_test.py <ESP32_IP>
   ```

**Interactive Commands:**
- `r` - Send ready status
- `p` - Start playback simulation
- `s` - Stop playback
- `q` - Quit simulator
- `h` - Show help

## LED Effects

1. **Progress Mode**: Shows actual playback progress
2. **Ready Blink**: All LEDs blink green
3. **Rainbow**: Colorful rainbow animation
4. **Pulse**: Breathing effect
5. **Chase**: Moving dot effect
6. **Solid**: All LEDs white

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **LEDs not working**:
   - Check power supply (5V, adequate current)
   - Verify GPIO 2 (D2) connection
   - Check ground connections

2. **Buttons not responding**:
   - Verify GPIO 4 and GPIO 5 connections
   - Check button wiring (pull-up configuration)

3. **WebSocket connection failed**:
   - Verify WiFi credentials in `main.cpp`
   - Check ESP32 IP address
   - Ensure firewall allows port 80

4. **Python simulator errors**:
   - Install required packages: `pip install websocket-client`
   - Check ESP32 IP address
   - Verify WebSocket server is running

### Serial Monitor Output

WebSocket server started on port 80
Client 0 connected from 192.168.1.50
Player 1 is ready
```

## Configuration

### LED Settings

Modify LED configuration in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#define LED_PIN 2           // LED data pin (GPIO 2)
#define NUM_LEDS 16         // Total number of LEDs
#define PLAYER1_LEDS 8      // Player 1 LED count (LEDs 1-8)
#define PLAYER2_LEDS 8      // Player 2 LED count (LEDs 9-16)
```

### Button Settings

Change button pins in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#define BUTTON_PLAY_PAUSE 4  // Player 1 control button (GPIO 4)
#define BUTTON_EFFECT_STOP 5 // Player 2 control button (GPIO 5)
```

### WiFi Settings

Edit WiFi credentials in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "VIVOFIBRA-WIFI6-2D81";
const char* password = "xgsxJmdzjFNro5q";
```
